# **flutter_icon_switcher**

Change your app icon at runtime!

## Known issues
* The plugin only works on Android, on iOS will work, but i'm working on it.
* On Android if you try to run the app via cli, for example `flutter run` (or from the ide plugin), the app will not launch if the current enabled icon is not the default.
